About Me
======================

I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. at CMU.
My research interests are in cyber-physical systems and Programming Lanugages.
I'm working on TTPython, a domain-specific programming language and runtime
designed to make distributed, energy-constrained, and time-sensitive applications
easier to program.
You can give a try [here](http://ccsg.ece.cmu.edu/ttpython/tutorial-index.html)!

Recent News
======================

I'm working on my thesis proposal. Check it out [here](Thesis_Proposal.pdf).

I will be helping on the 2023 S3D tenure-track hiring committee!

I was a co-instructor of CMU's Summer 2022 instance of the course
[15-213: Introduction to Computer Systems](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-m22/www/)
with [Zack Weinberg](https://www.owlfolio.org/).

The TickTalk team has submitted a paper on TTPython to OOPSLA 2022!
Unfortunately, it has been rejected :(.

I was a co-instructor with [Sol Boucher](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sboucher/) for
the Summer 2021 instance of the course
[15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/)
at CMU!
