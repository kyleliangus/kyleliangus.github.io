About Me
======================
I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. at CMU.
My research interests are in the Internet of Things and Programming Lanugages.
Specifically, I'm working on Gnomad, a programming language designed to make
distributed, energy-constrained, and time-sensitive applications easier to
program. This compiles to TTPython, a framework to support such applications.
You can give a try [here](http://ccsg.ece.cmu.edu/ttpython/tutorial-index.html)!

Recent News
======================
I was a co-instructor with [Sol Boucher](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sboucher/) for
the Summer 2021 instance of the course
[15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/)
at CMU!
