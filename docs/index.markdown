About Me
======================
I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. at CMU.
My research interests are in the Internet of Things and Programming Lanugages.
Specifically, I'm working on Gnomad, a programming language designed to make distributed,
energy-constrained, and time-sensitive applications easier to program.

Recent News
